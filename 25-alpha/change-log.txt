New alpha test directory:
/home/jsibert/Projects/SPC-Tagging/SPC2012/pttp/OneDegree/nominal/Grid23/alpha
apply devs to reporting rate / catchability
apparent lack of fit in history plot due to misunderstanding of fleet 0

rename alpha test directory reporting_dev_alpha

New alpha test directory

need to compute recap d3_array to count recap strata

Fleet 0 codes fleets not included in the par file


Attemp to estimate fmort(f) from average_F(f) inverse of comput_average_fishing_mortality

====================
/home/jsibert/PTTP2012/OneDegree/nominal/Grid23/fish_mort_alpha
using effort proxy, but perhaps the wrong observed tags in the likelihood. see history and attrition plots

Two new issues:

1) sums of observed recaptures too high
confusion about f=0 between effortless recaptures and sum of recaptures
f=0 => effortless recaptures obs0

2) quiltmap recaps do not extend to 208E
need to use slicemin()  and slicemax() for i and so on

Current ceill-based proxy TOO small.

Two types of effortless tag returns:
1) error in recording; data error
2) fleet not included in par file, because ie less than 100 returns

adding eflag recaps to fleet(0)

check effort averaging and number of fleets in allskj.ifr

problem with q was faulty initialization around line 604 in tpl
need to rethink ipar(25)

not enough obs in attr and hist files
needed += in vector accumulators
1G
changed name of alpha to recapture_dev

good results M still too high, but good agreement between predicted and all recaptures

Too many fish in the model - try release devs

============================

/home/jsibert/PTTP2012/OneDegree/nominal/Grid23/tag_surv_prop

Good initial fit (p001), but M -> 0 

Need to compare likelihood fish_mort_alpha p008
